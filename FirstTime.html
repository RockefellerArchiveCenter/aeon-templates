							<h2>Accessing Material at the Rockefeller Archive Center</h2>			
							
							<p>I understand that I am given access to the archival collections at the Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) on condition that I will not identify, either in my research notes or in publication or recording, any information documented in the records or papers of a confidential personal nature.
							</p>

							<p>Confidential personal material commonly found in RAC collections includes but is not limited to: Social Security numbers, bank account numbers and account statements, medical records and associated medical information less than 50 years from the decease date of an individual, personnel records including individual salary and benefits information, the individual names of reviewers of grant proposals and job applicants, and student records, academic grades and transcripts.</p>

							<p>In accordance with federal statutes and regulations, archival institutions may permit researcher access to medical records older than 50 years from the decease date of an individual. The RAC grants such access in accordance with the terms of scholarly use for a given collection.</p>

							<p>The purpose of this agreement is to assure the personal privacy of the individuals whose activities are documented by the archives. I accept this condition and the purpose for which it is created.</p>
							
							<h3>Journal of General Physiology</h3>
							<p>If accessing the records of the Journal of General Physiology, I agree that I will not take notes on or divulge the names of any reviewers consulted by the Journal of General Physiology.</p>

							<h3>The Medical Letter</h3>
							<p>If accessing the records of The Medical Letter, I agree that I will not take notes on or divulge the names of any reviewers consulted by The Medical Letter.</p>

							<h3>Paul Ehrlich Collections</h3>
							<p>If accessing the Paul Ehrlich Collections, I understand that I am given access to these records on the condition that I will not request duplicates of more than 25 pages per calendar year.  This restriction may be waived by the Head of Donor Relations and Collection Development, or a designee, by written request.</p>

							<h3>Population Council</h3>
							<p>If accessing the records of the Population Council, I understand that I am given access to these records on condition that I will not identify by name, either in my research notes or in publication or recording, the names of individuals who received or apparently received medical diagnoses and/or treatments, whose case(s), may be documented or mentioned by personal name in the Population Council records.</p>

							<h3>Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation Files</h3>
							<p>If accessing the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation Files, I agree that this access is expressly conditioned upon my agreement not to make specific reference in written form to the file of a specific Fellow. I understand and agree that the data extracted from these files shall be for scholarly, non-commercial purposes only.</p>

							<h2>Requesting Copies</h2>
							<p>Under certain conditions specified in the United States copyright law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish reproductions of documents and publications.  One of the specified conditions is that the reproductions are not to be "used for any purpose other than private non-commercial study, scholarship, or research." I understand that if I make a request for, or later use, a reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," I may be liable for copyright infringement.</p>

							<p>I also understand that I may request up to 2000 reproductions per year, and that the RAC reserves the right to refuse to fulfill a copying order, if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve (1) violation of copyright law, or (2) damage to the material.</p>

							<h2>Publishing Material</h2>
							<p>To the extent that it may do so legally, the RAC ordinarily will grant publication rights for scholarly purposes or other purposes permissible under United States copyright laws upon written request to the RAC by qualified applicants. Such written requests should include the proposed title of the publication, the collections to be cited, relevant publication information (the publisher of a book, journal title and volume number for articles, or the university and department for dissertations), and the expected date of publication.</p>

							<p>Researchers who plan to publish their work are urged to make inquiry concerning possible restrictions before beginning their research.</p>

							<p>If permission to publish is granted, I agree to cite the material according to the RAC's <a href="http://rockarch.org/research/citations.php">preferred elements of citation</a>. I understand that I am responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions, clearances or consents necessary to publish.</p>

							<p><strong>I have read, understand, and will abide by the terms of this agreement.</strong></p>
